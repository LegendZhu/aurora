The high performance version of Laravel is Lumen, but itâ€™s not good/fast enough. Lightning is trying to be a fast PHP micro-framework with elegant syntax. Laravel gave me a lot of inspiration, so you may find she a bit like Laravel.

**What, not fast enough? Still looking for extremely high performance solution?**
