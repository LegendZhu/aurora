The high performance version of Laravel is Lumen, but itâ€™s not good/fast enough. Lightning is trying to be a fast PHP micro-framework with elegant syntax. Laravel gave me a lot of inspiration, so you may find she a bit like Laravel.

### Features

 - Maintaining elegance without sacrificing performance
 - Modern toolkit, pinch of magic
 - Laravel's database agnostic migrations and schema builder
 - Laravel Elixir provides a clean, fluent API for defining basic Gulp tasks.
 - Useful helper functions
 - More to write...
